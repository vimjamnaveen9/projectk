## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Right-Sizing Resources

#### EC2 Instance Optimization

**Current State**: t3.micro/t3.small instances
```
Development: t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)
Production: t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Monitor CPU and memory utilization
- Use CloudWatch metrics to identify over-provisioned instances
- Consider burstable performance instances (T3/T4g)
- Evaluate ARM-based instances (T4g) for 20% cost savings

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Monitor instance utilization
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=AutoScalingGroupName,Value=8byte-app-dev-asg \
  --start-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2023-01-08T00:00:00Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Average
```

#### Database Right-Sizing

**Current**: db.t3.micro (development), db.t3.small (production)

**Optimization**:
- Monitor database performance metrics
- Use Performance Insights to identify bottlenecks
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Evaluate Aurora Serverless for variable workloads

### 2. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

#### EC2 Reserved Instances

**Potential Savings**: 30-60% for 1-3 year commitments

**Strategy**:
```
Development Environment:
- Consider 1-year No Upfront Reserved Instances
- Estimated savings: $5-8/month per instance

Production Environment:
- 1-year All Upfront Reserved Instances
- Estimated savings: $15-25/month per instance
```

#### RDS Reserved Instances

**Strategy**:
```
Production RDS:
- 1-year Reserved Instance for Multi-AZ
- Estimated savings: $15-20/month
```

### 3. Auto Scaling Optimization

#### Current Auto Scaling Configuration

```hcl
min_size         = 2
max_size         = 6
desired_capacity = 2

# Scaling Policies
Scale Up:  CPU > 80% for 10 minutes
Scale Down: CPU < 20% for 10 minutes
```

#### Optimization Strategies

**Predictive Scaling**:
- Implement predictive scaling for known traffic patterns
- Reduce reaction time for scaling events
- Pre-warm instances during expected traffic spikes

**Schedule-Based Scaling**:
```hcl
# Example: Scale down during low-traffic hours
resource "aws_autoscaling_schedule" "scale_down_evening" {
  scheduled_action_name  = "scale-down-evening"
  min_size               = 1
  max_size               = 3
  desired_capacity       = 1
  recurrence            = "0 22 * * *"  # 10 PM daily
  auto_scaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.app.name
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_schedule" "scale_up_morning" {
  scheduled_action_name  = "scale-up-morning"
  min_size               = 2
  max_size               = 6
  desired_capacity       = 2
  recurrence            = "0 6 * * *"   # 6 AM daily
  auto_scaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.app.name
}
```

### 4. Storage Optimization

#### EBS Volume Optimization

**Current**: gp2 volumes

**Optimizations**:
- Evaluate gp3 volumes for better price/performance
- Implement EBS volume monitoring
- Set up automated snapshots with lifecycle policies

```hcl
# Optimize to gp3
root_block_device {
  volume_type = "gp3"
  volume_size = 20
  iops        = 3000  # Baseline for gp3
  throughput  = 125   # MB/s
  encrypted   = true
}
```

#### S3 Storage Classes

**Current**: Standard storage for all objects

**Optimization Strategy**:
```hcl
# Lifecycle policy for ALB logs
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "alb_logs_lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.alb_logs.id

  rule {
    id     = "log_lifecycle"
    status = "Enabled"

    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    transition {
      days          = 90
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    transition {
      days          = 365
      storage_class = "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
    }

    expiration {
      days = 2555  # 7 years retention
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Network Cost Optimization

#### NAT Gateway Alternatives

**Current Cost**: $67.10/month for 2 NAT Gateways

**Alternative 1: Single NAT Gateway**
```
Savings: ~$33/month
Risk: Single point of failure
Recommendation: Consider for development only
```

**Alternative 2: NAT Instances**
```hcl
# NAT Instance (cost-optimized)
resource "aws_instance" "nat_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-00a9d4a05375b2763"  # AWS NAT AMI
  instance_type = "t3.nano"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[0].id
  
  source_dest_check = false
  
  tags = {
    Name = "NAT Instance"
  }
}
```
**Potential Savings**: $40-50/month, but requires management

#### Data Transfer Optimization

**Strategies**:
- Use CloudFront for static content delivery
- Implement compression for API responses
- Optimize database queries to reduce data transfer
- Consider VPC endpoints for AWS services

### 6. Database Cost Optimization

#### Storage Optimization

**Current**: 20GB allocated storage

**Optimizations**:
```hcl
# Enable storage autoscaling
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  allocated_storage     = 20
  max_allocated_storage = 100  # Auto-scale up to 100GB
  
  # Use magnetic storage for development
  storage_type = var.environment == "prod" ? "gp2" : "standard"
}
```

#### Backup Optimization

**Current**: 7-day backup retention

**Cost-Optimized Strategy**:
```hcl
# Adjust backup retention by environment
backup_retention_period = var.environment == "prod" ? 14 : 3
```

#### Multi-AZ Optimization

**Strategy**: Disable Multi-AZ for development environments
```hcl
multi_az = var.environment == "prod" ? true : false
```

### 7. Monitoring Cost Optimization

#### CloudWatch Optimization

**Current**: Custom metrics and detailed monitoring

**Optimization Strategies**:
```hcl
# Reduce monitoring frequency for development
monitoring_interval = var.environment == "prod" ? 60 : 300

# Optimize log retention
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "app_logs" {
  name              = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-app-logs"
  retention_in_days = var.environment == "prod" ? 30 : 7
}
```

### 8. Environment-Specific Optimizations

#### Development Environment

```hcl
# Cost-optimized development configuration
locals {
  dev_optimizations = {
    instance_type              = "t3.nano"
    min_size                  = 1
    max_size                  = 2
    desired_capacity          = 1
    db_instance_class         = "db.t3.micro"
    multi_az                  = false
    backup_retention_period   = 1
    enable_deletion_protection = false
    monitoring_interval       = 300
  }
}
```

#### Staging Environment

```hcl
# Balanced staging configuration
locals {
  staging_optimizations = {
    instance_type              = "t3.micro"
    min_size                  = 1
    max_size                  = 3
    desired_capacity          = 1
    db_instance_class         = "db.t3.micro"
    multi_az                  = false
    backup_retention_period   = 3
    enable_deletion_protection = false
    monitoring_interval       = 120
  }
}
```

## Cost Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. AWS Cost Explorer Integration

```bash
# Set up cost alerts
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id 123456789012 \
  --budget '{
    "BudgetName": "8byte-monthly-budget",
    "BudgetLimit": {
      "Amount": "200.00",
      "Unit": "USD"
    },
    "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
    "BudgetType": "COST"
  }'
```

### 2. CloudWatch Cost Metrics

```hcl
# Cost monitoring alarm
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cost" {
  alarm_name          = "high-monthly-cost"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
  metric_name         = "EstimatedCharges"
  namespace           = "AWS/Billing"
  period              = "86400"  # Daily
  statistic           = "Maximum"
  threshold           = "180"
  alarm_description   = "Monthly cost exceeds $180"
  
  dimensions = {
    Currency = "USD"
  }
}
```

### 3. Tag-Based Cost Allocation

```hcl
# Consistent tagging for cost allocation
locals {
  cost_tags = {
    Project     = "8byte"
    Environment = var.environment
    Owner       = "DevOps Team"
    CostCenter  = "Engineering"
    Application = "WebApp"
  }
}
```
