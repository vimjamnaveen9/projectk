## Network Security

### VPC Security

**Network Isolation**:
- Dedicated VPC with custom CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16)
- Logical separation from other AWS resources
- No default VPC usage

**Subnet Architecture**:
```
Public Subnets (DMZ):
├── ALB (Internet-facing)
├── NAT Gateways
└── Bastion Host (future enhancement)

Private Subnets (Application Tier):
├── EC2 Application Instances
├── No direct Internet access
└── Outbound through NAT Gateway

Database Subnets (Data Tier):
├── RDS PostgreSQL
├── No external routing
└── Isolated from Internet
```

### Security Groups

**ALB Security Group**:
- Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0
- Outbound: All traffic (for health checks to instances)
- Principle: Internet-facing load balancer

**Application Security Group**:
- Inbound: HTTP (8000) from ALB security group only
- Inbound: SSH (22) from VPC CIDR only
- Outbound: All traffic (for updates, API calls)
- Principle: Least privilege access

**Database Security Group**:
- Inbound: PostgreSQL (5432) from application security group only
- Outbound: All traffic
- Principle: Database isolation

### Network ACLs

**Additional Layer of Protection**:
- Default allow for legitimate traffic patterns
- Explicit deny for known malicious patterns
- Stateless filtering complement to security groups

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### EC2 Instance Roles

**Application Instance Role**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:8byte-*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:8byte-*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
